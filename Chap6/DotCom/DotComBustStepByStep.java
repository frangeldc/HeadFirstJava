	/*		Real preparation code for full code
	 * 
	 * 1 - Declare and initialize the variables we'll need
	 * 2 - make three DotCom objects, give them names and stick them in the ArrayList
	 * 3 - print brief instructions for user
	 * 4 - repeat with each DotCOm in the list
	 * 5 - ask the helper for a DotCom location
	 * 6 - call the setter method on this DotCom to give it the location you just got from the helper
	 * 7 - as long as the DotCom list is NOT empty
	 * 8 - get user input
	 * 9 - call our own checkUserGuess method
	 * 10 - call our own finishGame method
	 * 
	 * 11 - increment the number of guesses the user has made
	 * 12 - assume it's a miss, unless told otherwise
	 * 13 - repeat with all DotComs in the list
	 * 14 - ask the DotCom to check the user guess, looking for a hit (or kill)
	 * 15 - get out of the loop early, no point in testing the others
	 * 16 - this guy's dead, so take him out of the DotComs list them get out of the loop
	 * 17 - print the result for the user
	 * 18 - print a message telling the user how he did in the game
	 * 19 - create the game object
	 * 20 - tell the game object to set up the game
	 * 21 - tell the game to start the main game play loop (keeps asking for user input and checking the guess)
